##JS Color Clock

This was one of our first JavaScript projects for code school.
The assignment was to make a digital clock that 1) changes color,
2) shows the color's hex code when moused over and 3) has a bar
3) that accurately counts down the seconds.

While simple, this was my first real taste of coding in Javascript,
and I was hooked.
